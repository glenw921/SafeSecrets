            The earliest discovery of Titanis fossils occurred in the winter of 1961/1962, when amateur archaeologists Benjamin Waller
            and Robert Allen were searching for artifacts and fossils using scuba gear in the Santa Fe River on the border of Gilchrist and Columbia
            Counties in Florida, United States.[1][2][3] The two collectors donated their discoveries to the Florida Museum of Natural History (UF)
            later along with bones of equids, proboscideans, and many other Floridan fossils from the late Pliocene and latest Pleistocene.[1][4] Waller
            and Allen's avian fossils consisted of only a distal tarsometatarsus (lower leg bone) and a pedal phalanx (toe bone), deposited under
            specimen numbers UF 4108 and 4109 respectively. They remained without analysis in the museum's donations until they were recognized as
            unique by paleontologist Clayton Ray in 1962. He noticed the avian features and giant size of the fossils, which led him to believe they
            were from a phorusrhacid (or "terror bird", a group of large, predatory birds).[5][1] Ray also noted their stratigraphic origin; they were
            found in a sedimentary layer containing the equid Nannippus and "bone-crushing" dog Borophagus, indicating that they originated from the
            upper part of the Blancan stage (2.2–1.8 million years old).[6][7][1][8]
